# SOLID
SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are aimed at creating more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems. Here's a brief outline of each SOLID principle:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - A class should have only one reason to change.
   - Each class should have a single responsibility, meaning it should encapsulate only one aspect of the application's functionality.
   - This principle promotes high cohesion and makes classes more maintainable.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Once a class is written, it should be possible to extend its behavior without modifying its source code.
   - This is often achieved through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - This principle ensures that inheritance is used correctly and that derived classes adhere to the contract established by their base classes.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - This principle encourages the creation of small, specific interfaces tailored to the needs of the clients that implement them.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
   - This principle promotes the use of dependency injection, inversion of control containers, and the use of interfaces to decouple high-level modules from low-level modules.

Adhering to the SOLID principles helps developers create more maintainable, modular, and scalable code by fostering good design practices and reducing the impact of changes in one part of the system on other parts. These principles are often considered fundamental guidelines for object-oriented design.
